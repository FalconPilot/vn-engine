# Visual Novel Engine
This is a core engine I'm creating to let people create Visual Novels.
I'm using Electron.

# Will there be an editor ?
Yes, it's planned. Not my main concern though, the core engine is the priority.

Special thanks for the PMG Skype group, the Visual Novel concept this engine is
intended for on the first place is theirs. So without their idea, I wouldn't
have started working on it.
